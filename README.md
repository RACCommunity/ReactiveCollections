# ReactiveCollections
**ReactiveCollections** is a pilot project of change-tracking collection types and collection view bindings for [ReactiveSwift] and [ReactiveCocoa].

## To-do

- [ ] Evaluate and improve the practicality of the abstractions.
    - [x] Introduce a mutable `Array` container.
    - [ ] Introduce an immutable collection diffing operator.
- [ ] Build a collection binding API for UITableView that serves as a model for other collection views.
